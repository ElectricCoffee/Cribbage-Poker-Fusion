\section{3--4 Player Rule Changes}
To play this game with more players, simply reduce the number of cards taken from the deck in the crib by 1 for each player added.

For three players, each player discards one card to the crib, then a card from the deck is burned, and one added. For four players, no cards from the deck are needed.

\paragraph{Scoring Challenge Answer}
By my best counting, it's 16 runs of 3, two pairs, and a quad, which makes $16 \times 3 + 2 \times 2 + 12 = 64$ points.
