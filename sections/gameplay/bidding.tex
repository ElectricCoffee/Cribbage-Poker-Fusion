\subsection{Bidding}

After the cards have been dealt and two of the cards have been discarded into the crib comes the bidding phase, consisting of three rounds of bidding like in Texas Hold 'Em Poker: The \textit{Flop}, the \textit{Turn}, and the \textit{River}.

Before the Flop, the dealer must either call the blind or raise it.

\subsubsection{Flop}
Turn over two of the cards in the crib face-up onto the table in front of the players.

At this point, both players get a chance to bid or fold based on the current board-state.

\subsubsection{Turn}
Turn over another one of the face-down cards in the crib and commence another round of bidding and/or folding.

\subsubsection{River}
Finally, turn over the last of the face-down crib cards, and do one last round of bidding.
