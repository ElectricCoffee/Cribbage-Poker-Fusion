\subsection{Dealing}
Like in old-school Cribbage, each player is dealt five cards (not six). 
Each player then discards one of their cards into the crib face down.

Then ``burn'' one card from the top of the deck, and add the top two cards from the top of the deck to the crib, and shuffle the crib thoroughly.
