\subsection{Blind Bids}
Before a hand is dealt, a set of blind bids (blinds for short) must be placed, to create an ante.

It's ultimately up to you how you structure this, but here are some options for your consideration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Equal Blinds:} Both the dealer and the non-dealer ante the same blinds.
    \item \textbf{Small/Big:} Dealer gets the small blind, non-dealer gets the big one.
    \item \textbf{Non-Dealer Only:} Only the non-dealer makes a blind bid.
\end{itemize}
For fairness, make sure to play with the same blinds structure for the whole game.
